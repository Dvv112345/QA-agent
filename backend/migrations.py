"""Idempotent schema migrations run at every app startup.

``init_db()`` (``create_all``) only creates *missing tables* — it never
alters existing ones, so every schema change to an existing table ships
here as a migration step (Convention #11).  Each step inspects the live
schema and applies DDL only when it is missing, which keeps every run
idempotent and dialect-portable (PostgreSQL in production, SQLite in
tests).

A step may also be data-only — repairing rows a past bug left behind
(``_settle_orphaned_children``).  Same contract: it must match nothing on
the second run and nothing at all on a fresh database.
